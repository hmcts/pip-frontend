A vulnerability in this version of `semver` was recently identified and surfaced by `npm audit`:\n\nRegular Expression Denial of Service - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw\n\n### Details\n\nOriginal post by the reporter:\n\n\"my npm audit show the report\n\nsemver  <7.5.2\nSeverity: moderate\nsemver vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw\nNo fix available\n\nAnd my dependencies tree for semver show your package\n\n├─┬ stylelint@15.9.0\n│   └─┬ meow@9.0.0\n│        └─┬ read-pkg-up@7.0.1\n│             └─┬ read-pkg@5.2.0\n│                  └─┬ normalize-package-data@2.5.0\n│                       └── semver@5.7.1 deduped\n\nI found that meow@10.x.x contains normalize-package-data@5 and I can fix this vulnerability because it uses semver@7.  But I can't update meow to the new major version because your package doesn't allow it.\"\n\nUpdate your package to use the 'meow' version >=10\"\n\n### PoC\n\nN/A\n\n### Impact\n\nWe anticipate the impact to be low as Stylelint is a dev tool and `meow` is only used on the CLI pathway. \n\n---\n\n⬇️  EDITED AFTER PUBLISHED ⬇️ \n\n### Security fix backported to older `semver` versions\n\nThe same security fix has been backported to older `semver` versions of 5.x and 6.x. See the [CVE-2022-25883](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw) details.\n\nSo, you can fix this vulnerability by just updating `semver` in your project's dependency tree, instead of updating `stylelint`.
