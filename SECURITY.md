# Security Policy

## Purpose

This document outlines how security vulnerabilities should be reported for this repository.

HMCTS is committed to responsible vulnerability disclosure and to addressing legitimate security issues in a timely and coordinated manner.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it by email to:

**HMTCSVulnerabilityDisclosure@justice.gov.uk**

This email address is the sole approved point of contact for vulnerability disclosures relating to HMCTS-owned repositories and services.

Please do not create public GitHub issues or pull requests to report security vulnerabilities.


## What to Include in a Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much of the following information as possible:

- The repository, service, or component affected
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps required to reproduce the issue
- Any non-destructive proof of concept or exploitation details

Where available, the following additional information is helpful:

- The suspected vulnerability type (for example, an OWASP category)
- Relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages

Reports do not need to be fully validated before submission. If you are unsure whether an issue is exploitable or security-relevant, you are still encouraged to report it.


## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

When investigating or reporting a vulnerability affecting HMCTS systems, reporters must not:

- Break the law or breach applicable regulations
- Access unnecessary, excessive, or unrelated data
- Modify or delete data
- Perform denial-of-service or other disruptive testing
- Use high-intensity, invasive, or destructive scanning techniques
- Publicly disclose the vulnerability before it has been addressed
- Attempt social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks
- Demand payment or compensation in exchange for disclosure

These guidelines are intended to protect users, services, and data while allowing good-faith security research.

## Bug Bounty

HMCTS does not operate a paid bug bounty programme.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors and reporters are expected to act in good faith and in accordance with applicable laws and professional standards.
